# half-life-gauss

I tried to replicate Half-Life physics, Tau Cannon(Gauss), Long Jump and Auto Bunny-hopping. The feel is close enough.

I wanted to make a game out of it but noone (including my friends who love fast-paced FPS) finds this enjoyable except me, so here is the whole prototype. I can't provide support for this.

## Credits

Built over [TheAsuro/VelocityMovement](https://github.com/TheAsuro/VelocityMovement), which provides the bunny-hopping part.
Tau Cannon model and sound effects are from [Half-Life](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70) game.
